Vision

To impart quality education for producing highly talented globally recognizable technocrats and entrepreneurs with sound ethics, latest knowledge, and innovative ideas in Computer Science and Engineering to meet industrial needs and societal expectations.

Mission

To impart high standard value-based technical education in all aspects of Computer Science and Engineering through the state of the art infrastructure and innovative approach.
To produce ethical, motivated, and skilled engineers through theoretical knowledge and practical applications.
To impart the ability for tackling simple to complex problems individually as well as in a team..
To develop globally competent engineers with strong foundations, capable of “out of the box” thinking so as to adapt to the rapidly changing scenarios requiring socially conscious green computing solutions.
National Board of Accreditation (NBA) has formulated 12 Program Outcomes for Undergraduate Engineering Degree Programs of the country. These are listed below.

Program Educational Objectives (PEOs)

To produce students employable towards building a successful career based on sound understanding of theoretical and applied aspects as well as methodology to solve multidisciplinary real life problems.
To produce professional graduates ready to work with a sense of responsibility, ethics and enabling them to work efficiently individually and also as a team.
To impart the competency in students so that they are able to pursue higher studies and research in areas of engineering and other professionally related fields.
To inculcate ability to adapt to the changing technology through continuous
PROGRAM OUTCOMES

Engineering Graduates will be able to:

PO1. Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.

PO2. Problem analysis: Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.

PO3. Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.

PO4. Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.

PO5. Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.

PO6. The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.

PO7. Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.

PO8. Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice.

PO9. Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.

PO10. Communication: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions.

PO11. Project management and finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.

PO12. Life-long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.

PROGRAM SPECIFIC OUTCOMES (PSOs)

In addition to these twelve POs, 3 Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) are formulated for each discipline specific degree Program by the University.

PSO1. Ability to analyze, design, implement, and test software systems based on requirement specifications and development methodologies of software systems.

PSO2. Apply computer science theory blended with engineering mathematics to solve computational tasks and model real world problems using appropriate programming language, data structure, and algorithms.

PSO3. Ability to explore technological advancements in various domains, evaluate its merits and identify research gaps to provide solution to new ideas and innovations."
